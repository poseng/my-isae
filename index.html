            The Ingénieur ISAE-SUPAERO program has been designed in such way that students will follow at least a double major program. We could even do more than this. The main or primary major (la Filière) share the first three days of the week with languages classes
            and mangement and enterpreneurial classes. On every Thursday and Friday, we need to take classes of the secondary major or Domaine d'Application. It is very common in France's higher education to have a free Thursday afternoon. Thus, this
            school has proposed a complementary major or certificate program that we can earn along the Ingénieur ISAE-SUPAERO program. Personally, I have not chosen any complementary certificate program.

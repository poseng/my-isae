            Embedded Systems: design, modeling and architecture
        </h3>
        <p>
            Robots and drones are autonomous systems made up of a physical platform (sensors, actuators, processors) and software. The latter are organized in a logical architecture comprising of functional, supervisory and decision-making levels. This module deals
            with the main aspects to be taken into account when designing this architecture and the implementation of algorithms which constitute it, namely embedded systems on board the autonomous systems. The main concepts of this module could listed
            as the following:

            <ul>

            Perception and Navigation
        </h3>
        <p>
            This module introduces us to the famous area of GNC (Guidance, Navigation and Control). Autonomous navigation is the capacity for a mobile machine to move around in their environment without the intervention of a pilot. This capacity requires in particular
            that the machine perceives and models its environment, locate himself in place, and plans the displacement to perform. The objective of this module is to present the tools and methods to perform these functions, detailing in particular the
            localization, which plays a central role. The following concepts were introduced in a theoretical approach:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Introduction to autonomous navigation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Foundation of robotics perception: proprioceptive and extreroceptive sensors, data estimation and fusion.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Localization in instrumented (outdoor) environment (GPS, GNSS) and in a non-instrumented environment based on proprioceptive (odometry and IMU sensors). Simultaneous Localization and Mapping technique (SLAM).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Environment modeling.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Motion planning and Trajectories tracking.

                <li>
                    Today and the future application of autonomous navigation.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Most of the case study for this module were implemented in MATLAB and Python.

            Decision Making and Deliberated Actions
        </h3>
        <p>

            Autonomous decision-making is the ability to choose and plan actions according to objectives and context. It is necessary as soon as that the autonomous system has to face a variety of tasks and that his activity cannot be scheduled in advance by the
            designer. It implements synthesis functions of the plan of actions and interactions, refinement of actions and supervision. This module is a brief introduction to the techniques used to staff an autonomous system of deliberation capacities.
            It will highlight also the ethical questions posed by robots (aerial or terrestrial). Program:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Introduction: Deliberate action as a guarantee of autonomy; models and representations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Planning by state space search, Planning by decomposition of tasks.
                </li>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Deliberation : adaptation, reaction, supervision, goal reasoning, learning.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Delegation, Human-Robot and multi-actors planning.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Human and Robot : authority sharing, strength and weakness.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ethic : Ethic questions posed by the robots, in context of defense and security, with people, medical robots.
                </li>
            </ul>

            PDDL served as a tool for implementing and testing of our robot planning algorithms.

            behaviors of the users. The main goal of this course is to treat the fundamental principals of informatique security.

        <h3>Real-Time Systems</h3>
        <p>In this course, we are interested in the real-time systems that are present in various applications such as <span style="text-transform: lowercase;">Aeronautics, space, nuclear power plants,
                train or even medical.</span> The proper functionning of these systems is essential to meet user requirements. This fact depends not only on the accuracy of the result povided, but also on the time of their generation. In this course we
            study the performance of different systems architectures of the mono-processor, multiprocessor and communications systems via on-board networks. This study take into account the impact of scheduling policies von the response times of different
            applications, but also that of the operating systems on their execution time.

        <h3>Model Driven Software Engineering</h3>
        <p>
            This course deals with the implementation of correct code through a model-based approach to code generation and validation techniques. This course is made up of two main parts:
            <ol>

                <li>
                    MBSE (Model-Base Systems Engineering) and synchronous approach for critical software.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Formal methods for software engineering
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            The first part of the course has the following objectives:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Learn to write the systems requirements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Understand the modeling at systems level by using SysML as a support language.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Implement the synchronous approach to the model and produce its critical software.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Implement a modeling method by starting from the systems and ending at the software.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Experiment with the benefits of tools that can detect our design error on the model itself (Model-Checking method)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Understand the ins and outs of critical code generation, particularly for the critical applications in human life.
                </li>
            </ul>

        </p>
        <p>
            In term of software and tools: <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The SysML models will be edited and simulated / verified using the free software called TTool from Telecom Paris (TTool implements concepts published in articles co-signed by the IpSC research group of the DISC department of ISAE-SUPAERO and by Telecom
                    Paris LabSoC laboratory).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Ansys SCADE workshop will be used to edit synchronous models, simulate / verify these models, and generate codes that are ready to be embedded on the card.
                </li>
            </ul>

        </p>
        <p>
            The second part of the course presents several software validation techniques which is the activity that consists of verifying that a software meets the requirements defining it. This can be done conventionally by testing the software, but for complex
            and critical systems the formal methods are now used to prove that these systems are correct with respect to their specifications. Formal methods provide mathematical theories and practical tools for reasoning about correcting software.

        </p>
        <p>
            The aim of this part of the course is to present three different approaches to validate all or part of software:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>Deductive Methods</em> will be presented either through the C programming language and the ACSL specification language, or through the SPARK language. Demonstrators of automatic theorems like Alt-Ergo, 4 or Z3 will be used. </li>

                <li>
                    <em>Model-Checking</em> on linear temporal logic (LTL) will be used to prove high-level properties on a program (liveness etc.)
                </li>

                <li>
                    <em>Abstract Interpretation</em> is a theory that approximates the behavior of a program and can be used to prove properties on complex software (for example using numerical calculations).
                </li>

            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            A general introduction to these approaches will be given during the first session of the course. Students will then choose a deepening track corresponding to a particular method (3 or 4 students per method). During the 12 hours dedicated to each "track",
            students will be supervised by a specialist in each technique and will approach the field from a theoretical but also a practical point of view. A common case study (autopilot, SCAO) will be used and the students will present their work and
            their conclusions (pros and cons of each technique) during a mini-workshop. Finally, an industrial feedback on the use of these techniques, in particular in the aerospace industry, will be made.

        <h3>Avionics Seminars</h3>

        <p>
            Embedded systems are tightly integrated with the system governing them to fulfill their mission: controlling an engine, helping the pilot, guiding a vehicle, etc. As such, their hardware and software components must be ready to fulfill their mission,
            to interact in their environment, but also to resist their environment. In this course, we cover the practical elements to consider when building critical systems for the space and avionics fields.
        </p>
        <p>
            We first review the generic concepts of IT architectures, hardware and fault tolerance mechanisms. Then, conferences by ISAE industrial partners will return to the main challenges when designing critical systems.
